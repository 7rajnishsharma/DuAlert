# Duplicate Download Alert System (DDAS)  

## What is DDAS?  
The **Duplicate Download Alert System (DDAS)** is a **Chrome extension** that helps prevent users from downloading the same file more than once. It watches your downloads and **alerts you** if youâ€™re trying to download a file that already exists on your computer.  

It works by checking the **SHA-256 hash** (a unique code) of each file, so even if the file names are different but the content is the same, DDAS will recognize it as a duplicate. This helps save **storage space** ðŸ’¾ and keeps your files organized ðŸ“‚.  


#### What is SHA-256 Hash?  
SHA-256 is a method to create a **unique code** ðŸ”‘ for a file based on its content. Even if the file name changes, its SHA-256 code stays the same. DDAS uses this to detect duplicate downloads accurately.
